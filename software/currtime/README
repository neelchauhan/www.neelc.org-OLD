== WHAT IS currtime? ==

currtime is an enhanced command-line operated real time clock.

== FEATURES  ==

 * Time displayed in Unix-compatible format
 * Shows the current time on the same line
 * Can run for a specified number of ticks (seconds) with the -T (ticks) flag
 * Suffixes for the -T option: 'M', 'H', and 'D' to run currtime for a
   specified number of minutes, hours, or days respectively
  * LIMITATION: Only one suffix can be used at runtime
 * Option to display each tick on a new line with the -n flag
 * Ability to display a tick number preceding a tick with the -t flag
 * Option to execute program after -T ticks with the -e flag

== GETTING STARTED ==

If you obtained currtime from a package provided by a Linux distribution like
Ubuntu, or a non-Linux based operating system such as FreeBSD, you probably
have already installed currtime. If so, you can just type in "currtime" in a
shell prompt to run currtime, and press CTRL-C or CTRL-Z to exit currtime and
return to the shell.

Otherwise, you'd have to compile currtime yourself. In order to do this, you
need a Unix-like operating system and a C compiler. If you have both, then
you'd need to download and extract the currtime source code, and then you can
just run this at your shell prompt:

	$ make

From there, if you just want to run currtime without installing it, then try
this (provided you're in the same directory you ran "make" in):

	$ ./currtime

If you want to install it officially, you can run one of the following:

	( if sudo is used to gain superuser/root privileges )
	$ sudo make install
 --OR--
	( if su is used to gain superuser/root privileges )
	$ su
	# make install
 --OR--
	( if logged in as root )
	$ make install

Keep in mind that currtime installs into /usr/local/bin by default. This can be
overrided by changing the Makefile.

After you installed currtime, you can run currtime by just running this:

	$ currtime

To view the help information, you can run this:

	$ currtime -h

== WINDOWS USERS ==

Right now, I have not tested currtime on Windows, and therefore, currtime may
or may not work on Windows. Keep in mind that this may change in the future.
