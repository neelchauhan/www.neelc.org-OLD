== WHAT IS currtime? ==

currtime is a command-line operated real time clock. currtime displays the
current system date and time in a Unix-compatible format.

== Getting Started ==

If you obtained currtime from a package provided by a Linux distribution like
Ubuntu, or a non-Linux based operating system like FreeBSD, you probably have
already installed currtime. If so, you can just type in "currtime" in a shell
prompt to run currtime, and press CTRL-C or CTRL-Z to exit currtime and return
to the shell.

Otherwise, you'd have to compile currtime yourself. In order to do this, you
need a Unix-like operating system and a C compiler. If you have both, then
you'd need to download and extract the currtime source code, and then you can
just run this at your shell prompt:

	$ make

From there, if you just want to run currtime without installing it, then try
this (provided you're in the same directory you ran "make" in):

	$ ./currtime

If you want to install it officially, you can run one of the following:

	( if sudo is used to gain superuser/root privileges )
	$ sudo make install
 --OR--
	( if su is used to gain superuser/root privileges )
	$ su
	$ make install
 --OR--
	( if logged in as root )
	$ make install

Keep in mind that currtime installs into /usr/local/bin by default.

After you installed currtime, you can run currtime by just running this:

	$ currtime
