<h2>But isn't this illegal?</h2>
<p>Many people may believe that Tor equals illegal activities. Tor itself isn't
illegal, but the things you can do on it can be. Tor by itself is an anonymity
tool, which can be used for both legitimate and illicit activities.</p>
<p>Tor is often refered to a tool used by criminals, and often, many refer
to the illicit uses of Tor, such as trading drugs on the <i>Silk Road</i>
(which I'm not going to link to). While Tor is that, but it is also a tool to
evade firewalls, surveillance, and even censorship!</p>
<p>A more descriptive overview of Tor is avaliable on the
<a href="https://www.torproject.org/about/overview">Tor Project's</a>
website.</p>
